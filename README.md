# USDANASSDatausingAPI
The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) offers Quick Stats, an on-line database containing official published aggregate estimates related to U.S. agricultural production. 
In this project, I provide codes for accessing data from USDA NASS using API.

To use the Quick Stats API, you must first agree to the NASS Terms of Service and obtain an API key. See this link https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/api

Next, use the few lines of codes provided to access the needed data. In this project, I provide two examples:
1) accessing 2017 state level ag land values. 
2) accessing prices paid from years 2000 to present.
